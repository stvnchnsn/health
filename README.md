# health

Longterm this project will maintain a database that keeps track of health metrics, exercises as well as schedules exercies and eventually it will be used as an online app.  
Intitially workouts will be emailed automatically using an smtp server and a Raspberry Pi.

Run initial_db_setup.py to initilize the database.
